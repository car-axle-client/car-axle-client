> [!NOTE]
> A recent update to ChromeOS (v115/v116) released in August 2023 has blocked all javascript bookmarklets. If you use a managed Chromebook and **Devtools are turned off** (that means Inspect element, etc.) then car axle client won't work. Look at alternate methods here: https://github.com/car-axle-client/car-axle-client/blob/main/docs/alternate_injection.md
